# Azure Sky Media

Welcome! This repository contains the sample Azure media web application that is deployed at http://www.skymedia.io

The following set of functional capabilities are integrated and enabled via this Azure ASP.NET Core MVC web application:

* Adaptive video streaming across a broad spectrum of devices and platforms including iOS, Android and Windows

* Consumer user identity and platform service account management for Azure Storage, Azure Media Services, etc

* Securely upload and process your media via transcoding, indexing, thumbnail generation, content protection, etc

* Generate metadata via content analytics such as face, object and motion detection to enable discovery and action

* Create subclips (either as dynamic filters or as new assets) via a standard web extension to the Azure Media Player

* Define workflows with multiple tasks (executed parallelly and/or sequentially) that utilize various media processors

* Track content workflow with automatic output publishing based upon parameters specified at job submission time

* Optionally enable SMS text message notification of workflow completion via self-service user profile management
