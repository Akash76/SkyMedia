# Azure Sky Media

Welcome! This open repository contains the sample Azure media web application that is deployed at http://www.skymedia.io

The following set of functional capabilities are integrated and enabled with this Azure ASP.NET Core MVC web application:

* Self-service user and service account management across Azure Media Services, Azure Storage, Signiant, Aspera, etc

* Upload and process media via encoding, indexing, content protection, metadata generation, adaptive streaming, etc

* Define media workflows using multiple tasks (executed parallelly and/or sequentially) across various media processors

* Track media workflow tasks and automatically publish outputs based on parameters specified at job submission time

* Generate media metadata such as face, emotion and object detection to drive discoverability and actionable insights

* Generate media subclips (either filtered views or rendered assets) via web clipper integration with Azure Media Player

* Optionally enable SMS text notification of media workflow completion status via integrated user profile management

For screenshots of key application modules, take a look at https://github.com/RickShahid/SkyMedia/wiki
